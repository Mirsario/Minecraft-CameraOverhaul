## ❗ What's this?!
**CameraOverhaul** a clientside Minecraft mod that attempts to improve overall satisfaction of the game through the introduction of various camera rotations, to emphasize on the player's movement and improve visual feedback. Strafing and turning around will tilt the camera sideways. Jumping, falling, and moving forward/backwards will affect the camera's pitch.

### Info:
- **Available** at [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cameraoverhaul) & [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cameraoverhaul);
- **Made** for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) & [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org);
- **Requires** [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config);
- **Supports** Minecraft versions from `1.14` to `1.19.2` and up, releases are version-agnostic;
- Works best at high framerates - [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight), [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium), and other [optimization mods](https://modrinth.com/mods?f=categories%3A%27optimization%27) are **recommended**.

## ⚙️ Can I turn off X and only keep Y?
You can use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (or an alternative of your choosing) to configure the mod in-game.

You can also manually find the configuration file with intensity scaling for all features at<br/>
`.minecraft/config/cameraoverhaul.json`.

Set any factor to `0.0` to turn its feature off.<br/>
Negative numbers are also usually legal, allowing inverting effects, if that's your thing.
